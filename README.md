# Work Day Scheduler Starter Code


## Description
This assignment was to create a planner that helps the user plan out their work day. By color coding each hour, it helps the user identify where they're at in the day and how they are doing in their task list.

## Challenges
The biggest challenge I had was setting up localStorage to `getItem`. It took a lot of trouble shooting and assistance with the TA's to help me set up the proper JavaScript to get the data saved in localStorage. Once I was able to figure that out, the rest of the assignment wasn't too hard to complete.
